# MongoDB  
  Welcome to Fabien Bruge's MongoDB Project
  
  There are 3 programs :  
    - Ex1Ex2-WorkerProgram.py : gets cities self-service bicycles stations and stored into a database every 500s (8m20). I decided to make the 2 first programs in one, so stations are also updated (tpe or availibility changes, new station created...)  
    - Ex3-UserProgram.py : a client program to find stations around a specified GPS point location  
    - Ex4-BusinessProgram.py : offers many options and operations to do like an update, a deletion or gives all stations with a ratio bike/total_stand under 20% between 18h and 19h00 (monday to friday)

  These programs have been developped with VSCode in Python and MongoDB languages.  
  Packages needed to run these programs are specified in requirements.txt
  To launch a program : in command console, run python -u <path><filename.extension>
